## General info
The brief from Chungu was to build a web application to allow users to search for books using the Google Books API. Since I'd only used APIs in JavaScript, I chose to do this in React. And once I'd started I learnt about TypeScript, so then added that in. I also used Styled Components as I was curious about CSS-in-JSS. I used Axios to fetch the data because I'd heard about it, heard that it made things easier, and wanted to try it out.
